# Brido-KRAI-2024-Computer-Vision
Welcome to the Brido KRAI 2025 Computer Vision repository! This is the code of the program that i make for Brido, Airlangga University Abu Robocon's team use on our very first time qualified to compete at national competition last year. There are only 3 main part on the process in making this whole program. Because the program was created by only one person with minimal experience and knowledge in the realm of computer vision and a small time limit, please forgive me if the program created is less complex and interesting. But for those of you who might be looking for a quick and easy alternative to computer vision, maybe this repo will help.
